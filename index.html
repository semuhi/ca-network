        <h2>Semuhi Sinanoglu</h2>
        <p>Semuhi is a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science and a course instructor at the University of Toronto. His academic research is about how autocrats politically control the elites and generate support for repression in polarized environments.

His co-authored papers are published in high-impact academic journals such as Comparative Politics and Sociological Methods & Research. He is also the co‑founder of a Toronto‑based political risk consultancy company, which leverages big data to forecast protests and elections. 
          He is a graduate associate at POSTCOR Lab. Previously, he was a Trudeau Centre Fellow at the Munk School, a resident fellow at the Jeanne Sauvé Foundation, and a Regional Manager at the Digital Society Project. </p>
